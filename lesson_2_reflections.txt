1) What happens when you initialize a repository?
   Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, a .git directory
is created which holds all the "behind the scenes"
stuff for managing the repository for the current
dirrectory.  This is what allows Git to know that
the current directory will now be under version
control.

2) How is the staging area different from the
   working directory and the repository?
   What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is different from the working
directory because it is a construct inside Git
whereas the working directory is the actual
directory inside the filesystem you currently at.
The staging area allows you to group files that
you wish to commit in a single commit to the 
repository.
